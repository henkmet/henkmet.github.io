Was there a problem with the seal in the pump?' Silas asked the engineer, 'It looks like the rubber has failed. How did that happen?' 'Sulphuric acid is one of the important substances in its manufacture', came the reply from the engineer, 'and I have not been able to make that. As a result we obtained an outlet by which the air could escape.' 'And I nearly drowned.' Silas wasn't sure whether he should be angry at the engineer, 'Next time don't experiment with my life, do you understand? We do need to explore the underwater for food and to find whatever it is that you need to build your miraculous machine that will see us home but I'm not ready to die for it. Any, I want to go explore more of the island tomorrow. And for now good night.'

So the engineer has a plan to get them home but needs something from the sea floor for that (note how I sneakily introduced that myself; somehow needed to keep things moving a little bit.) The engineer does make poor judgement calls due to unavailable materials.

'I am going to explore a bit of the island and see if I can get us something for dinner other than pigeon's eggs.' said Silas. He strung up a few snares on one side of a clearing and then made a wide berth around the clearing, trying to chase some animals into his snares. The island was alive with grass, which the rabbits appeared to be eating. They looked around them, saw him and therefore ran straight to their sorrowful end in the snares. Silas brought them back to the camp, where they were already asked for by the impatient Gideon.

I haven't really made a character for Silas as such but just rolled some fate dice to determine whether the hunt would be successful. It was and so I brought in 5 extra snippets containing 'rabbit'. Since we already established that Gideon is curious, by association I thought he would also be the impatient one. Not entirely logic, I know, but I'm not sure yet whether I want to introduce a sailor at this point. Or maybe Gideon is a sailor after all and not a reporter?

<p>'It's getting very cold', Silas remarked. 'Soon we won't be able to look for anything in the water at all.' 'It's because we are at a very elevated latitude', mused the engineer. 'but while last night it was too stormy for the task of passing the ice bridge to the islet on top, the weather has become still.' 'Then we shall cross tomorrow to the islet, if you think that we can find useful materials there to build us a brig.'</p>

<details Class=meta gaming>

So, it's getting cold and we're far north (or south) and there's an islet off the coast of the island that looks promising. Let's see whether we can get there safely. Since we already know there is ice, I'll bring in a few lines extra with the letters ice in it.

<p>'A brig we shall no doubt make with sticks and trunks but we need one grain of magnetite rock, which is situated on the other side of the ice bridge', said the engineer. 'That's what we hope at least,' sighed Silas, 'But let's go while the wind is not too strong.' The ice and the snow were enough to terrify even the reporter but it allowed them to go very quickly to the islet. 'And now let's hope we can find your magnetite', said Silas.</p>

We made it to the other side of the ice bridge and are on the islet. The rock made me think of magnetite, since wood should be abundant on their original island; in the fist scene we saw that there is a forest. I'm getting a bit less literal with the snippets but I think still fairly close.

<p>Silas picked up an unfamiliar looking stone. 'Hey, look, this stone looks odd'. The engineer almost overthrew him and felt the rock in his hand. 'It is evidently not of normal weight and that gives positive proof!' he cried, 'We can now go back to our lodgings'. 'Well, that went a lot faster than I had anticipated', says Silas.</p>

And so ends our excursion to the islet, I think. I have the feeling that Silas should be much more active. I'll try that in coming sessions.
