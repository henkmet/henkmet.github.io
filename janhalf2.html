<h1>January 2024 - a new oracle</h1>
<body>
<p>Suddenly the door slams open and Benedict walks into the kitchen. "Euphemia? Is that you? No, where is Euphemia? Who are you?" In a reflex, she has hidden her face. "It is me but I haven't powdered my face," she says. Fortunately her voice is still her own. "You'll never believe what happened in town. Some people, trash! Plebs! Anyway," he tries to control himself after a short outburst, "They have set up a guillotine on the market and they have murdered the mayor. But the weirdest thing is, his head just disappeared… what… are you alright?" he asks as he sees Effie slide down her chair, faint and deadly pale as well as… old. It is all she can do to point at the rafters where the mayor's mouth now sinks open in a morbid grin. "What? But you? You were always here?" Weakly Effie nods. "Then? By what evil magic does this head appear in my kitchen?"</p>

<p>New prompt. Horror: Abandoned Amusement Park.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Mr Benedict," says Effie in a tear-choked voice, "but I am so scared. I want to go… can… can I follow you to look for Mr Olin? I shall walk behind you but please don't leave me here alone.""Yes," says Benedict after just a moment's reflection, "It's already late evening. And you know. Someone told me that they saw Olin where the Astley Circus used to be. We'd better go immediately then we can arrive there before midnight."</p>

<p>When they come outside, thick clouds are moving in front of the full moon so that the street is at times brightly lit with deep dark cast shadows, at other times pitch black. They take the landaulet and Mr Benedict allows Effie to sit rather close to him as he holds the reins. The horses, sensitive to his mood and to their surroundings, are jittery and he needs to keep all his attention on the reins. The cooling night air and the emotions earlier that evening cause Effie to shiver uncontrollable. Benedict tries to calm his horses by talking softly but his voice too sounds oddly harsh and metallic. Effie is glad when they reach the former circus.</p>

<p>The large tent has gone but a few rusted cages have been left behind, their doors swaying in the wind, producing a scraping sound. A pile of leaves lies around a tree that stands bare, ready to grow new leaves come spring time. Its branches too move in the wind, causing the shadows on the ground to dance around erratically. Benedict does not protest as Effie holds on to his arm. The living touch goes some way to dispel the oppression that goes out from this deserted place. "Why would Mr Olin be here?" asks Effie, "This place feels so… unfriendly." (Time for a new prompt. Horror: Old Bookshop)</p>

<p>Benedict wants to say that she shouldn't exaggerate, that ghosts are not real, but he can't force the words out of his throat. He shrugs and points to a path between the cage and the tree; it is here they will start their search. Underneath the tree Effie has the sensation that something grabs her in the face. She half suppresses a yelp and feels her face with her hands. The sticky threads of a cobweb come loose with little difficulty but a residual tugging sensation stays with her. Meanwhile, they have come to the other side of the cage. The rest of the terrain is empty, patches of grass grow between rubble. There is no place for anyone to hide.</p>

<p>A rustling among the dead leaves betrays the presence of mice and not much later a dark shadow drops from the sky. A soft thump is all they hear as an owl makes off with its prey. Nothing unusual. Or is it? "Mr Benedict?" "hmmm?" "Shouldn't mice be dormant in winter? I've never seen them about in this time of year." "Oh. hmmm," answers Benedict vaguely. He had never given mice much thought and now he was preoccupied with the search for his friend. Presently, Effie notices a brighter patch in the grass. It looks like paper. "It wasn't here just now," says Benedict as she points it out to him. He bends over to pick it up. "A visiting card? The address is… but that is odd." "What is odd, Mr Benedict?" "The card is new," he says, tapping it with a finger, "but the shop named on it has closed years ago."</p>

<p>New prompt, since it is essentially a new scene.</p>

<p><ol>
<li>Faerie Tales: Evil Magic (again!)</li>
<li>Horror: Isolated Village</li>
<li>Faerie Tales: Wicked Step-parent</li>
</ol></p>

<p>"And not only is the shop closed," he continues, "it is in a really out of the way place. A small village in the middle of nowhere." "Where is it, Mr Benedict?" "The shop is called 'Long, Long Ago' and is in Deledorff." "But why in such a strange place?" "It was started by the son of the vicar in that village, really long, long ago now. He died last year and there was nobody to take over the shop."</p>

<p>While talking they have returned to the landaulet. "Do we have to go tonight?" Effie asks. A smirk crosses Benedict's face. "Would you rather go back to the house?" he asks sardonically. "N-n-nooo." A shiver travels down Effie's spine at the thought of the scene in the kitchen. "I just want to stay with you, Mr Benedict." The horses are glad to leave the gloomy place but the way to Deledorff is not much better. Their progress is slow with the horses stepping carefully. After midnight Effie feels strange. Bringing her hands to her face, she notices that the spell by Lord Blackthorn has worn off.</p>

<p>Blackthorn…" she says out loud. "What's with that blackguard?" grumbles Benedict. "He had promised to help look for Olin, but I have not heard anything from him since." "I don't trust Blackthorn's promises," Benedict says, "he always exacts payment that's much more than you thought you agreed to." (Is Effie back to normal? Very likely, d6=yes. Does Benedict notice it? 50/50: no). "But Mr Benedict, look at me. His price was that I would look like an old woman till midnight and now I look like myself again." "Still, I don't trust him. Look, there's the village."</p>

<p>All the houses in the village are dark and all the dogs must be asleep. At least, none starts barking. But they are watched, Effie is certain of it. The shop is next to the village pump. Benedict stops the landaulet in front of it. Drip… drip… drip. "The pump drips," says Effie. "Someone must just have been using it," Benedict tries to shrug it off. "Nobody is even awake." In her fright, Effie nearly raises her voice at her employer. "I'm sorry Mr Benedict," but this one now looks a bit pale as the implication of Effie's words sinks in. "I guess you're right, though," he says. "Let's go inside." (Is the door locked? 5+. 5: yes) The door is locked. This is not the custom in a small place like Deledorff. "Maybe there's another door at the back," says Benedict and takes a few large strides. "Wait," says Effie, anxious not to be alone. (Does he wait? 50/50: yes). He waits just long enough for her to grab his arm again and they walk around to the back door. This is open and they enter the shop. (someone is reading evil tomes. Blackthorn? likely, yes)</p>

<p>"Ah, there you are. Finally. I had expected you to be here half an hour ago." The dark figure of Lord Blackthorn looks up from his crouched position. "He had fallen asleep," thinks Effie at first but then she realises that he had been absorbed in a book without any light! As her eyes accustom themselves to the gloom inside, she realises that the book that Blackthorn is holding glows with a dull purple. "You… you said you would help Mr Benedict to find Mr Olin," Effie says. She tries to sound firm and accusative but all she can manage is to sound whining. "The night is not over yet," the fey says simply, "and here I have what I need to call him here," he continues, indicating the book in his hand. (Will he summon Olin (1-4) or step parent (5-6) 1: Olin Who is the step (d6=) father of? 1-4 Olin, 5 Effie, 6 Benedict. 6: Benedict).</p>

<p>Blackthorn snaps with his fingers and suddenly five black candles that are placed around a pentagram on the floor are burning. "But this is…" "The way to see your friend. Silence now!" The fey starts an incantation that is not at all loud, yet it resonates inside Effie's skull, bouncing and echoing till she feels her head is about to burst. She presses her fists on her ears and pinches her eyes close in an attempt to keep the sound out. Suddenly it is quiet again. She opens her eyes and sees Olin in between the candles on the pentagram. (Is he alive? 5+.6: yes) "I… I feel strange. How did I get here?" Blackthorn laughs his unpleasant laugh. "Tell them what you have been up to, friend. That's Benedict, there, and his kitchen maid with blood on her dress. He brought her along because he doesn't dare to go out alone after dark."</p>

<p>"Ashbrooke," says Olin, "didn't you know we thought it was time to deal with the old and corrupt powers?" "The… the guillotine… tell me you have nothing to do with that!" (Did he? 2+. 3: yes, he did). "I didn't… ouch!… didn't … owwww!" Again the laugh of Blackthorn bounces against the books. "You can't lie when you're in the circle, you know. hahaha." "I… yes, we have set it up to… well." "But that is criminal!" (Did they also decapitate the step father? 50/50. 6: yes)</p>

<p>"I dare bet the mayor wasn't the only one," says Blackthorn, evidently enjoying himself tremendously at the expense of poor Olin. "Dinan, what does he mean?" "Nothing… owwwww" "HAHAHAHA" "You can see he's mad. Let me out of this accursed circle." "The truth" "HAHAHAHA" "We… I… you know" "The truth! Now! Olin, what have you done?" "Your stepfather was evil, you know?" (Was Benedict aware it was his stepfather? 50/50: no) "Father? What did you do with my father?" Benedict wants to lunge at Olin but he can't go into the circle. "Tell him, HAHAHAHA" "Not your father, Benedict, your stepfather!" "Nooo" "He was evil" (Did Benedict have any inkling of that? very unlikely. 6: yes) "Not that evil… he, always took good care of me." "Locking you up?" "HAHAHAHA" "I always had enough food." " His leftovers! And when were you going to get married?" " He… he was looking for a bride for me" "Took his time, didn't he?" "HAHAHAHA" "And now?|" "Don't you see you're better off without him?" "Father!" "No. Stepfather."</p>

<p>Benedict sinks to the floor, the fight suddenly gone out of him. "You're next, Olin!" he says grimly. "But Mr Benedict. Mr Olin has been your friend for so many years!" "Well, not anymore." They turn to look at eachother but it's suddenly dark. The candles have gone out and Olin is no longer there. They look at the chair where Blackthorn had been sitting, but this too is now empty.</p>

<p>A dim, purple glow is the last light slowly fading to pitch darkness.</p>
