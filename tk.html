<h2>The Dark Eye</h2>
<p>
The Dark Eye is originally a German system (Das Schwarze Auge) and has been around since 1984. We played it in its very first edition (in Dutch). At that time further expansions were promised but unfortunately these never made it to the market in the Netherlands. Now, in the time of internet and pdf's, I decided the time had come to reacquaint myself with the system and bought a bundle of holding with some 2300 pages of TDE. The setting is in Aventuria, a mid-sized continent conveniently containing all climes and cultures you might wish to role play in. Though magic exists and gods are real, it has a realistic, low fantasy feel to it. After forty years of development the setting is incredibly detailed, which is something that I like.
</p>

<h2>Theatre Knights and Bornland</h2>
<p>Until some 800 years ago, Bornland was inhabited by goblins. The Theatre Knights, an order of knights following the warlike goddess Rondra, defeated the goblins and conquered the land. For a 'real world' inspiration of Theatre Knights, think of the Knights Hospitaller. The Theatre Knights rules Bornland for some 200 years, becoming increasingly brutal and corrupted until the priest-emperors of the Middle Realm, followers of the god of light and justice, Praios, removed them from power. Despite this the descendants of the Theatre Knights, the Bronjars, form the nobility of the land, proud of their heritage. There are still goblins living in Bornland, in its capital city of Festum they even have burgher letters, making them citizens. Furthermore there are Norbards, descents of a southern people. For a real world inspiration of those, think of Sinti and Roma (gypsies). Finally, in Festum there is a population of Maraskan refugees.</p>
<p>In this campaign, the heroes will take part in events in Bornland but they will also learn much of its background and discover secrets of the history of the Theatre Knights. The campaign starts in the autumn of 1039 after the Fall of Bosparan (FB). I arbitrarily chose 29 Boron for the start of the prelude.</p>

<h2>The heroes</h2>
Player characters are called heroes in TDE/DSA. I start the campaign with four of them, all four locals from Bornland:
<ul>
<li> Elkwin of Geestwindskoje. A Bronnjar and recently graduated knight from the Neersand academy.
<li> Irinja Garkinen. A Norbard and Blessed One of Ifirn.
<li> Mulziber. Maraskan carpenter from Festum.
<li> Rowena Firunkis. Toad witch from near Bangra.
</ul>
