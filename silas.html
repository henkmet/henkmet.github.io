I had tried the cutup method before but hadn't come very far. I am going to try again! This time I use <em>Mysterious Island</em> by Jules Verne to hopefully get some adventurous vibe.

<p>Since it's interesting (I think) to see what snippets were available for the story and how I used them, I will update them before every paragraph. In order to not complete overwhelm the page, they'll be be collapsed and can be viewed when clicking the relevant line. The same goes for the selection of snippets made for the paragraph (curated snippets) and my thoughts about the progress (meta game). Of course Silas' words and deeds are my own contribution and don't need approval of snippets. Enjoy reading!</p>
