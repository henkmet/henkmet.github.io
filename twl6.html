The innkeeper serves them a meager breakfast the next day. He clearly hasn't forgotten the previous day's incident.<br>
- Jaruslav?<br>
- That one has traveled on to Cherrydale.<br>
- Let's take the first ferry then, Irinja suggests.<br>
The ride to Cherrydale passes without incident, although it is noticeable that the layer of snow is getting thicker.<br>
- If the snow gets any heavier, Marja says, we'll have to put slats under the wheels. (A kaleschka can be transformed from a carriage into a sledge by fitting slats under the wheels).<br>
Toward evening, Cherrydale comes into view. The impressive city wall with its five magnificent towers and the cherry and apple orchards around it, all covered with a layer of snow, all of this gives the impression of a winter dream. During the latter part of the ride, the landscape has become increasingly rugged but now the heroes have an evening in pleasant company ahead of them. The tallest of the towers is that of the duchess. Two large, white flags bearing the coat of arms of her house &mdash; a circle of seven cherry blossoms on a red field &mdash; hang to the left and right of the gate.<br>
The main street is clean and the houses are neatly whitewashed. Between them are stores, picturesque craft places and inviting inns. But beyond the sight of the main street, Cherrydale also has its slums and its hard-working serfs.
Their kaleschka rolls through the town gate, and the heroes first stall the kaleschka and horses in the Honey Pot. Elkwin asks the innkeeper what's on the menu.<br>
- No, says Olko, we must first find out where Jaruslav has put Jääni and Bruutsch.<br>
- Soon there will be no one left on the street, Mulziber says, besides, it's too cold outside at night. (trial streetwise. Irinja: fail, Rowena: QL1, Elkwin: fail, Mulziber: fail).<br>
Thanks to Rowena's instinct and some pointed questions, they end up at a chatty baker's after only a few minutes.<br>
- What can I help you with? Some nice loaves of bread for dinner? Here, have honey bread, it's always nice when it gets colder outside.<br>
- No, no, says Olko.<br>
- It is. At least for me it is says Mulziber.<br>
- I don't need a whole loaf, says Rowena, I'll share with Irinja. And do you have an old crust with it for my toad?<br>
- Ifirn in greeting. Yes, I will share a loaf of bread with Rowena.<br>
When everyone finally has their bread and has paid, Olko can ask his question: Do you happen to know when Jaruslav returned to town?<br>
- The son of the duchess? He came a few days ago, with some men and two captured goblins. Those were tied up because they had tried to escape.<br>
The heroes, all with full mouths, look at Olko. This one turns a little red.<br>
- Tied up? But&hellip; well, you didn't, after all. But where are they now?<br>
- He went into the Duke's Tower with the whole lot. I think he moved on after that but no one knows exactly where to.<br>
Outside it is getting really dark now.<br>
- Come Olko, says Irinja, who meanwhile has finished her bread, we had better go to the inn. Tomorrow morning we can see further.<br>
Olko agrees and first goes to the Hesinde shrine. Irinja sits on a snowy field just outside the city wall to meditate. Mulziber seeks the warmth of the inn.
