<h1> Episode 7</h1>

I roll for a new plotline and later for a combo which joins it with the curse.
<ol>
<li> Crescendo.
<li> Ill will. (actor: Ye Qingge, object:  new character: scientist caring -> medical doctor (d6=) male; Wen Shirong)
<li> Meta: plot line combo.
<li> Character connection severed. (characters: Su Fu, Han Fenhang)
<li> Meta: character steps down (can't recall for sure, I think Yunru. not represented in play)
</ol>
Oracle phase. Did the doctor treat someone that Y.Q. wanted left untreated? very likely: yes. Someone we know already? 50/50: no! Then who? guard poor -> someone who takes the part of the poor = people with debts. What was the connection between Su Fu and Han Fenhang? starting outside. Related to this story? very unlikely: yes. Caused by the ritual? very likely: yes. How to sever? inform representative. Was Han Fenhang another taoist? 50/50: no. Another ritual with the stone needed? 50/50: yes. Is Han Fenhang affected by the curse? very unlikely: no!

<p>- Do we have to walk back to Nanxing now? What a hassle, grumbles Hou Fan.</p>
<p>- Yes, we have been led by the nose. There is nothing else for it.</p>
<p>As fast as they can, they make the trek back to Nanxing. Fortunately, as a nun with a begging cap, you never have to worry about food. At least, not about your own food, but you do have to worry about the food of Yunrus village. At the gatekeeper of Xiangshan, they had inquired again about Yunru, but still there was no news there. They had reported that they would return to Nanxing.</p>
<p>Already that city looms in the distance before them. At the gatekeepers, they ask for Han Fenhang's address. (Question: is it known? impossible: no) The gatekeeper looks at them inquiringly.</p>
<p>- Weren't you here the other day too? asks (d6=) he. Yes, I remember it again. Anyway, of Han Fenhang, or a Han clan for that matter, we have never heard of.</p>
<p>- We could go to the East Quarter again and ask the lender there.</p>
<p>- Hmmm, she just gave us the runaround last time. We'd better come up with something else.</p>
<p>- I could try another play den, Hou Fan suggests.</p>
<p>Yes, I don't have a better idea either. But I think it's better if you keep the name Han Fenhang to yourself. Somehow, something is not right here. (Question: is Hou Fan getting intelligence? 50/50: yes)</p>
<p>Moments later, Hou Fan comes out again, beaming.</p>
<p>- Come along, he says and leads Dong into a back alley (question: is there indeed an Ah Long there? likely: no).</p>
<p>- Are you sure we should be here? I don't see anything that looks like an office.</p>
<p>- I don't get it. It should have been here.</p>
<p>-They fooled you. Come, let's go back to the main road. (Q: Will they bump into Su Fu there? very likely: yes)</p>
<p>- Look Reverend, there's that Taoist.</p>
<p>- How can that be! He is in Xiangshan.</p>
<p>Yet the man approaches them and turns out to be the master.</p>
<p>- Master, how did you end up here? asks Dong (reaction +2:12) but &hellip; you look tired.</p>
<p>- Won't you call me Su Fu &hellip; but you're right. The ritual has created a connection between me and that Fenhang. That is a very unpleasant situation and very tiring. To do something about it, I need the stone as a focal point for a ritual.</p>
<p>- Then can you tell us where Fenhang is? We are struggling to find him. (Question: can Su Fu do that? No way: no + event: character negative: Fenhang, waste dreams)</p>
<p>Su Fu smiles faintly, 'No, that's not how it works unfortunately. But it's as if he can get into my dreams. It's very tiring to keep him out of it. That's why I have to do something about it.'</p>
<p>Dong takes out the stone.</p>
<p>- But where do you want to do that ritual? Surely not on the street? she asks, thinking of the frightening sounds of the previous ritual.</p>
<p>- There is an old temple there. That is where I will seclude myself. You two wait outside, says Su Fu, accepting the stone.</p>
<p>Dong takes the opportunity to make some offerings. (Question: sounds again? very unlikely: no)</p>
<p>After some time, Su Fu comes out again. (Question: does he need medical attention? Sure thing: yes + event: move towards thread (curse), propose, dispute)</p>
<p>- But master, you look even worse than before. Has something gone wrong? (question: has there? unlikely: no)</p>
<p>- The bond is broken, if that's what you mean Dong. And I'm still well enough to hear that you still don't call me Su Fu.</p>
<p>He tries to sit down on the ground but it rather ends up with him collapsing.</p>
<p>- You need a doctor, Dong says.</p>
<p>Su Fu tries to wave her away but doesn't have the strength and his hand plops down again.</p>
<p>- Hou Fan, get a doctor over here!</p>
<p>- Yes, Reverend, says this one, impressed by Su Fu's exhausted state.</p>
<p>A moment later he returns with a doctor, (d6=) He feels Su Fu's pulse, 'Congestion and narrowing of the veins due to great exertion, aggravated by emotional stress and disturbed sleep' the doctor diagnoses, 'I will write a prescription but above all you will have to take it a little easier. And no immortality elixirs for a week please.' (question: has he already had any trammel with Y.Q.? likely: no!, Coming now? sure thing: yes)</p>
<p>Then a (d6=) man approaches, by the looks of it someone's servant, 'You would do better to stop meddling in matters that don't concern you,' this one says to the doctor.</p>
<p>- Why, is a sick person none of my business as a doctor (reaction: 8)?</p>
<p>- You would do better not to involve yourself in other people's affairs.</p>
<p>- I am not going to start a quarrel with you.</p>
<p>The servant clearly spews out a memorised message: 'If my master has taught someone a lesson, you have no business treating that person.'</p>
<p>The doctor almost pops with anger, but before he can say anything more the servant walks away.</p>
<p>- Who did you treat to deserve such an approach? (reaction: 8)</p>
<p>- Those bastards &hellip; not you reverend &hellip; a gang of moneylenders. They commit violence and I have treated their victims. That's my business.</p>
<p>Dong pricks up her ears, ' We also have reasons to talk to those moneylenders. We will install our friend, pointing to Su Fu, on a rest bed with medicine and then we would like to talk to you again, doctor. My name is Dong Liu, my travelling companion here is called Hou Fan, the patient's name is Su Fu.</p>
<p>- Pleased to meet you. Wen Shirong. Hou Fan knows where to find my house.</p>
<p>Not much later, Su Fu is installed in an inn. Dong and Hou Fan spend the rest of the day gathering the ingredients for the medicine.</p>
