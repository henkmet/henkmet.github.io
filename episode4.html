<h1> Dong Liu &mdash; episode 4</h1>
<body>
I was so happy with the new plotline opened in the last episode that I re-rolled the plot points as it contained a conclusion result. Of course, the new plot point #1 was again conclusion. No messing with fate.
<ol>
<li> Conclusion</li>
<li> The promise of reward</li>
<li> None</li>
<li> Run away!</li>
<li> Willing to talk</li>
</ol>
<p>
#1 reward for  turning in Chunhua? very likely but: no. Helping her then, likely: yes. The promise is made by the weavers? likely but no. By Yunru, unlikely: no. Chunhua? 50/50: still no. Rolling on the table gives new character: not connected to plot line, dangerous, guardian. This is also the character for . #4 sees Qi Dan having to run away. Since he's already dead, it must refer to the past; probably related to how he ends up in the village.</p>

<p>Still on their way to the East Quarter, Dong and Hou Fan were accosted by a heavily armed court official. Reverend, let me put something in your begging bowl, and he does the deed, clearly having something on his mind. Is something bothering you, sir? asks Dong, accepting the donation gratefully.</p>
<p>'Yes,' says the man, 'the atmosphere in the city is tense. There is import of silk from outside the prefecture and this is causing great discontent among local artisans. I am afraid that violence will be used and then it will be difficult because it is not clear whether these traders are breaking the law. If they do and we protect them, it will cost us our heads but if we catch them and they turn out to be innocent then too. The magistrate is preparing a scheme to kick them out of the prefecture. Don't you want to pray to the Buddha that no fights break out until then? We want to pay you well for it.' Dong is startled, 'Violence is always bad,' she says, 'Of course I will pray for that to be dispensed with, but, this new scheme, what exactly does it entail?' 'I shouldn't really say that but since you are a nun, I guess it won't hurt. The magistrate is going to allow the local silk merchants' guild to do import levies and has set penalties for evasion. That will bring peace again!' 'I understand and I will pray for the absence of violence. 'Where can I find you for your reward?' ' I can't tell you that right now. Just ask at the temple for Dong Liu. I will leave a message for you there. To whom should I address it?' 'Cai Enlai.'</p>
<p>When Enlai has walked on, Dong turns to Hou Fan, 'We'd better look for Yunru. If that arrangement takes effect they will be able to frame Xiao. She'd better leave the prefecture.' (Question: can they find Yunru? 50/50 no).</p>
<p>After half an hour, they still haven't found Yunru. 'We should have agreed on a meeting point,' Dong grumbles.</p>
<p>(question: is Qi Dan from this town? 50/50 no) (question: is there a Qi clan house in this town? 50/50 no)</p>
<p>Hou Fan looks around. 'There's a play den there. Maybe we can make inquiries about Qi Dan there while we're here.' 'You'd better do that alone,' Dong remarks, 'I'd stand out quite a bit there.' (question: do they know Qi Dan there? likely, no) Hou Fan goes in but comes back out a moment later, unconvinced. (question: do they find Yunru now? 50/50 yes)</p>
<p>As they head towards the East Quarter, they suddenly bump into Yunru. 'Yunru, you really need to warn your friend,' Dong says, 'There are new rules in the making that can be used against her.' (question: has Yunru found Xiao Chunhua? very likely, yes) (question: is XC leaving already? very likely, no) 'Oh, I had already found Chunhua, but I can't convince her to leave yet. But with what you are telling now, I' ll manage.' 'Go now and then look for us later in the East Quarter.'</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hou Fan sees another play den. 'Let me try there too' 'I will wait here.' (question: Is Qi Dan known here? likely, no) Again Hou Fan comes out empty-handed. 'I don't think Qi Dan is from this town. No one has ever heard of him.' Without further ado, they now head to the East Quarter.</p>
<p>As the gatekeeper had already said, the moneylender is easy to find. 'Good afternoon,' Dong greets (d6=) her. 'May we ask you something?' (response +2: 9). 'I am rather busy. Would you like to borrow money? No? I don't want to be rude, but &hellip;' 'Please,' Dong says, pulling out the Lanying Stone (question: does she recognise it? sure thing, yes) (response: 11) 'A Lanying Stone. I hope you don't think I have anything to do with such things,' says the woman coolly but still visibly intrigued. 'No, no,' Dong says, 'We found the stone with someone who had committed suicide. We're looking for a way to lift the curse.' 'Then you have to pay back the loan.' (question: can she see who had given the stone? very unlikely, no) 'I know,' Dong says, 'but since we didn't take the loan, we don't know where to find the lender.' 'Sorry, I can't help you with that either.' 'The gambler's name was Qi Dan, maybe that tells you something.' (question: does it tell her anything? most definitely, yes) 'Qi Dan, yaaaaaaaaa, that sounds familiar. Isn't that the good-for-nothing from Nanxing? Yes, now I remember it again. He had to leave the city there headlong because he had all the moneylenders after him.' (question: would they have had a Lanying stone? definitely not, no) 'but they didn't have access to a Lanying stone. He must have got that somewhere else.' With those words, the woman walks away without greeting.</p>
<p>Since Dong has to wait for Yunru anyway, she goes to a temple and prays for a peaceful outcome. When Yunru and Hou Fan pick her up, she tells the clerics there that she is travelling on to Nanxing.
