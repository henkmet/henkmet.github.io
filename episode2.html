<h1> Dong Liu &mdash; episode 2</h1>
<body> For this episode, I rolled the following plot points:
<ol>
<li> Distraction
<li> Betrayed!
<li> None
<li> A needed resource is running out
<li> Frenetic activity
</ol>
<p>
Rolling on the lists, #1 involves a new character: cautious driver deliverer. #2 has Yunru betraying Dong. No need to roll for #4, that's food and #5 will relate to the cautious driver losing control over the cart.</p>

Dong put on her begging robe and grabbed her begging bowl. She went with Yunru to the village to see for herself how things were going there. When they are almost in the village, a merchant comes after them with several cartloads of food and other merchandise.</p>
<p>- We have to hurry, Dong says, We have to prevent the villagers from spending that money. Come on!</p>
<p>- Yes, teacher Dong, says Yunru and sets off running.</p>
<p>Just then, a patch of fog blows along the forest edge and a breath of wind makes the trees move. But no? There is no wind, is there? It is stirless. And is that plaintive call really an owl? In the middle of the day? After another call, the patch of fog dissipates.</p>
<p>The horses behind them, sensitive animals as they are, prance and whinny and even the merchant sits on the buck with glassy eyes. Faster and faster the carts come rolling towards them. Dong and Yunru dive to the side of the road. Unscathed, they end up in a dry ditch and watch the four carts drive off the road one by one as well. One of the carts comes straight towards their hiding place and again they have to duck. They do not get away in time and suffer slight bruises as the merchandise rolls over them.</p>
<p>Yunru lies groaning, but Dong urges her on.</p>
<p>- We don't have time for that. We have to hurry.</p>
<p>Then the merchant approaches.</p>
<p>- I'm so sorry, Reverend. I always drive so carefully, but now &hellip; the horses &hellip; it's like they saw a ghost. And honestly, I was distracted too.</p>
<p>- It may have been a ghost apparition, Dong said, There is a soul wandering around here that cannot yet enter the realm of the dead. That is precisely why we are on our way to the village.</p>
<p>- We can travel together, reverend, says the merchant. I will gladly let you ride with me. Only it will take some time before we have all the wares back on the carts.</p>
<p>- That's very kind of you, ehhh</p>
<p>- Qiu Yue</p>
<p>- Qiu Yue, but we are in quite a hurry. We'll walk ahead.</p>
<p>Quickly, well, as quickly as possible with their aching legs, they walk to the village. There they find the people panicking. It soon becomes clear why: not only the rice in the fields, but also that in the storage sheds is decaying. Distraught, the villagers stare at the inedible grains.</p>
<p>- Reverend! Yunru! Didn't you see a merchant on the way? He would bring us food.</p>
<p>- No people, Dong says startled, listen to me first! This condition is a curse. The curse of Lanying. The gambler who committed suicide here the other day had borrowed money from an Ah Long. As long as that is not repaid, that curse will remain in force. You really must collect all the money you won from him and &hellip;</p>
<p>- But we need that money to buy food.</p>
<p>- Teacher Dong, you can see they are hungry. How can you ask money from them?</p>
<p>Dong looks around confused. That Yunru in particular is turning against her now is a setback.</p>
<p>- It is the only way to break the curse. If you stock up on food now, that too will perish and then? Please. It won't be easy, but it's the only way out.</p>
<p>- But if we give all our money to you now we will be starved before that curse is lifted, says someone posing as the village spokesperson. The other villagers nod in agreement.</p>
<p>- And even if you can lift that curse, what should we eat? This?</p>
<p>He lets the rotten grains slip through his fingers.</p>
<p>In the distance, the wagons full of food become visible.</p>
<p>- Ask him to deliver the food to the temple and come and get your meal there. We'll have to arrange payment later, Dong says desperately.</p>
<p>- If that merchant agrees, the spokesman says hesitantly.</p>
<p>- I will personally guarantee. The temple is not entirely impecunious.</p>
<p>- But Reverend, if I don't get payment now, I won't be able to stock up on new supplies. Then I won't be able to do anything except sit at home.</p>
<p>- I can give you what the temple has in its coffers as an initial deposit.</p>
<p>- Well, in that case &hellip; I mean, I felt that spirit myself; I don't want to do that to those people.</p>
<p>One of the villagers walks up to Dong.</p>
<p>- I can't work on the land now anyway, but I'm good with my hands and can handle a sword. I will gladly travel with you to find the money lender who has this on his conscience.</p>
<p>- What is your name?</p>
<p>- Hou Fan</p>
<p>- Good, Hou Fan. But promise me you won't use that sword unnecessarily. We are not out for revenge, just to lift the curse. Don't forget that!</p>
<p>- As you say, reverend.</p>
