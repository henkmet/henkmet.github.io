The next day, the kaleschka is early in front of the temple of Rum and Grog. Marja ter Munden tends the horses while Olko lashes his chest with writing utensils. One by one, the heroes come outside. Only Elkwin has a lot of luggage with him; his weapons and armour alone fill a large part of the boot. The others, however, travel light and so everything still fits easily. The heroes, especially Mulziber, are delighted that they have already received half of their fees in advance. Irinja, who is not used to sitting inside much, sits on the buckboard next to Marja; the others take their seats inside. Timpski and his guards have been on the road for about two weeks. How much of a head start Jaruslav has over them they do not know exactly since Pr√§hnwart could not say how long he may have been unconscious at the scene of the raid. Marja wants to explain the route to the heroes but apart from Mulziber they all know the area well enough so there is no need.<br>
- But what is the route then? Mulziber asks the others once they are seated.<br>
- First along the Bornweg to Harmkelen, then we turn off to Cherrydale and finally on a dirt track to Harden. With a Kaleschka, it will take about two days, Elkwin reckons.<br>
Around noon, they arrive in Aldenov, a small town which still has two inns, The Dead Crow and Ashcourt. They decide to eat something in Ashcourt. The cherry harvest has been good this year and the heroes enjoy the fresh cherries. Marja, on the other hand, feasts on dried cherries, of which she also takes a bag full on the horse-drawn carriage as they ride on again. Mulziber is amazed at all they see.<br>
- What a lot of space here. And so few people. But it's a good thing we are in the kaleschka otherwise I would be scared of the wild animals.<br>
The others have to laugh a little at the carpenter's urban feelings.<br>
- Mulziber, the animals are precisely my friends, says Irinja.<br>
- And if not, I always have my weapons, Elkwin further reassures him, which is met with a perturbed look from the Blessed One.<br>
- Surely, if there is no emergency, animals do not need to be killed.<br>
Rowena busies herself with her own animal, warty.<br>
At dusk, the heroes arrive in Nivesel. It is a slightly bigger place than Aldenov and the choice for the night is between inn The Swan and The Bustling Weasel. Naturally, Irinja wants to go to The Swan, named after the animal that symbolises Ifirn. When they want to go inside, they are accosted by a young woman with freckles.<br>
- Shall I show you around the village? I ask no more than a farthing per person.<br>
Mulziber wants to go immediately, determined to make the most of this tour. Elkwin looks a little sour at the prospect of having to pay the girl. He thinks, in fact, that this is beneath him and that she should show him around for nothing. But Mulziber's enthusiasm persuades him. Irinja and Rowena also readily accept the offer although they don't think they will get to see much new.<br>
- But we need to book beds first, Rowena says practically.<br>
Not much later, they walk behind the girl, Girte. Girte talks incessantly.<br>
- Nivesel was built by the Theatre Knights shortly after Festum, she explains, look, some of the buildings still date from that time. Also the lower part of De Zwaan. Do you see how old those stones are? The Theatre Knights were a very powerful order; they followed Rondra and Rondra gave them victory. That's how Bornland was freed from the goblins. But later they were defeated by those treacherous priest emperors with their Sun Legion. Look, here is the old city gate and over there is still a section of an old collapsed wall. If we walk down another street, there is an old watch tower without a roof.<br>
When the heroes arrive at the tower, they see that a thick tree root has pushed up the old stairs, causing cracks to appear. (Trial perception -1. Elkwin: failed. Irinja: QL1. Mulziber: failed. Rowena: failed)<br>
- Look, says Irinja, that spot in the tree bark, that looks just like a face, see that? With his mouth wide open. Like he's screaming.<br>
However, the others don't see it and then Irinja doesn't see it anymore either. Maybe it had been a sign from Ifirn?<br>
- I want to climb the top of the tree to see if magic is involved, says Olko, Adeptus Minor for a reason. (Trial climbing: failed)<br>
However, he falls and Mulziber, who had helped him up, gets him on his roof. (1 damage point (SP) for Mulziber, 10 SP for Olko). Girte stands there looking somewhat bewildered.<br>
- Have those cracks been in the stairs for a long time? asks Rowena.<br>
- No, says the girl, that happened only recently.<br>
Rowena looks at Olko's injuries (test of healing wounds: QL1). The niceness of the tour has now worn off. Besides, the heroes have seen the whole village.<br>
- But I still don't know whether magic was involved, Olko hums.<br>
Arriving at The Swan, it is time for the meal. Marja has already unharnessed and groomed the horses. The innkeeper is talkative and tells a few things.<br>
- Since the Stoerrebrands left the country, trade has been in the hands of Norbards and the Free Alliance. Captain Timpski cursed them when he passed through here. He said they have no sense of tradition and that is why they stole the Thorwaler Drum.<br>
- Also, have you seen Jaruslav of Cherrydale-Krabbwitzkoje here recently? Asks Elkwin.<br>
- What a man. He always has to prove himself with all his warriors and squires. And then that big dog of his.<br>
- But you haven't seen him? With goblins, perhaps?<br>
- Goblins? They did come here the other day. Usually I prefer to keep them out but these looked neat and their money is as good as anyone's so I thought, why not.<br>
Olko looks at him with mixed feelings, ready to defend the goblins but there is no need. Then they finish eating and go to bed tired. (Mulziber recovers fully during the regeneration phase, Rowena regains five astral points (AsP)).<br>
(The travelling goblins should not have passed by here on their own because they had been captured before. I had misinterpreted this scene)
