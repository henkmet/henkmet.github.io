A very short episode this time and no die rolls involved other than plot point generation. Speaking of which:
<ol>
<li> Meta plot point: character steps up: Dong Liu.</li>
<li> None.</li>
<li>None.</li>
<li> Into the unknown.</li>
<li>A moment of peace.</li>
</ol>
<p> With a Buddhist nun as heroine, this can only mean a meditation or meditational dream, can it?

<p> Dong stands on a road. It is foggy, but around her she can discern the shadowy outlines of people. To her left, hungry people extending their hands to her. To her right, people sitting behind a loom. In front of her are Yunru, Hou Fan, Han Fenhang and Su Fu. Su Fu beckons her to follow a path, but her feet do not move from their place. Then Yunru and Han Fenhang each walk in a different direction, leaving a narrow path in the misty landscape. 'Where is the road?' she suddenly hears her teacher's voice. She wants to point to the little path along which Han Fenhang walked; she should follow it, but it is gone. Then she wants to point to Yunru; she must find her again, but she too is gone. Now how should she help the people in the village? But suddenly they too are gone, and the weavers were never there. 'Everything you know, everyone you know is an illusion. Let go of the illusions and step into the unknown; there is the way.' She stands alone. There is no road, and that is good. Everything is unknown; that too is good. She falls into a deep sleep; or maybe it is no sleep and that too is good. The next morning, she emerges from her room refreshed.
