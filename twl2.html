And so Elkwin is off early the next morning. When he arrives at Rowena's, the goblin just wakes up from his deep sleep. Immediately he starts tossing and talking restlessly again.<br>
- Olko. Jääni, Bruutsch.<br>
- Now you need to calm down first, Rowena says and gives him an herbal brew to drink.<br>
Indeed, this seems to calm him down a bit.<br>
- So. Now first tell me your name.<br>
- I am Prähnwart.<br>
- Good, Prähnwart. And who is this Okko you keep talking about?<br>
- Olko. Olko is human but nice. He's always talking to us. A friend! And he's so clever. He can do magic in the human way.<br>
- Ah so, says Rowena, who refrains from saying that she magically patched him up yesterday. And what's this about the kidnapping? Tell me quietly!<br>
- I was supposed to take Jääni and Bruutsch to the Red Sickle. But evil men jumped out of the bushes and took us. Kidnapped! But I managed to escape. I have to warn Olko. Olko will help us.<br>
- And where do we find this Olko of yours?<br>
- Olko usually in the Temple of Rum and Grog.<br>
- Where is that temple? I've never heard of such a god, says Irinja.<br>
- It's a tavern, says Prähnwart, in Festum.<br>
- I was on my way to Festum anyway to ask if I can serve in the knight's order.<br>
- I live there.<br>
- And Warty and I really need to go to the Hesinde district. Besides, I won't leave Prähnwart alone with you. He might just have another relapse.<br>
And so, on 30 Boron 1039 BF, they set off for Festum. With some support, Prähnwart can walk by himself, although they have to rest often. As a result, it is already late afternoon when they arrive in Festum. As they walk past a shop, they hear noises inside. The door opens and the shopkeeper points someone out with a theatrical gesture.<br>
- If you cannot pay, I cannot sell you anything&hellip;<br>
An enraged Bronnjar faces him red-faced. Elkwin recognises Gerwin of Gravinsk-Wetpants.<br>
- You know who I am, don't you? Our family has been buying here for generations and we have always paid our bill. But surely we are not, not, not paupers for you to be so disagreeable.<br>
- It's the new rules of the Free Alliance.<br>
- Bah. Greedy grabbers, that's what you are. All of you, every single one of you. I challenge you to a duel!<br>
- Gerwin, says Elkwin, you should rather&hellip;<br>
- Mind your own business, brat. I'll decide for myself who I challenge. Otherwise, you're next!<br>
- You should! I just finished my training. Trained through! (test intimidation: failed)<br>
- But sir, folks like the shopkeeper and me; we have to do as we are told. We cannot really act freely, Mulziber says. (test on persuasion: QL 2).<br>
The Bronnjar calms down somewhat.<br>
- People like you, eh? Well it's a good thing you have nothing to choose&hellip;.<br>
But in the meantime, he does let go of his mace and hesitantly grabs his purse.<br>
- They are still nasty bums, he grumbles, as he pays.<br>
Nearly has Prähnwart brought the group to the Temple of Rum and Grog when they are accosted by a beggar woman.<br>
- Do you have a groat for a veteran?<br>
It is not yet a very old woman, maybe still in her 30s, but in front of her left eye she wears a patch and her left leg is stiff and she pulls with it.<br>
- Please, she begs, I can no longer fight, no longer work since I was wounded in the battle against Uriel.<br>
- Sometimes such injuries are not real, notes Elkwin.<br>
- Let me have a look, Rowena says (test healing wounds: failed), No those wounds are too old to heal and also to see what made them. But that's not necessary (test human knowledge: QL 1), you can tell by looking at this lady that she's not lying.<br>
- You fought a good fight, says Irinja, I will bless you. She mumbles something and indeed the woman, Jadvige is her name, seems to be feeling a little better though her injuries are not getting any better. Mulziber searches his pockets and comes across a groat.<br>
- Here. I have to look for a new job anyway, he says timidly.<br>
A figure detaches itself from the shadows. It is a guard, a still young woman, about Elkwin's age.<br>
- It's good to see that people have respect for the veterans who have defended our homeland, she says, even someone who doesn't really belong here gives something out of gratitude for being allowed to stay here. (test of people skills: QL 3). Mulziber wants to say he was just feeling sorry for a fellow human being but then thinks it might be better to let the guard be under the delusion.<br>
- Yes, that's just the way it is, he adds, just to be sure.<br>
They say goodbye to Jadvige and go into the tavern.<br>
- There is Olko. Olko, says the goblin excitedly.<br>
A young man, apparently still a student, is sitting at a table in busy conversation with some of his fellow students. When he sees the group entering, he stands up.<br>
- Prähnwart, what happened? You are injured!<br>
- Olko! Kidnapped! Jääni, Bruutsch!<br>
- Kidnapped? By whom? Oh no, oh no!<br>
- I don't know. Armed men. I didn't know them. I fled, but they wounded me. These people here have helped me. Good people.<br>
For the first time, Olko realises that a group has come in with the goblin.<br>
- Ah, just bandaged him up a bit and let him rest, Rowena says simply.<br>
- I wanted to go to Festum anyway, says Elkwin, as if to provide himself with an alibi.<br>
Quickly everyone introduces themselves; then Olko turns to Prähnwart again.<br>
- But what exactly happened? Festum can't be that unsafe, can it?<br>
- No. I had to take Jääni to the Red Sickle. She, er&hellip; she has to live there for three years because she angered my mistress.<br>
- Mantka Riiba? How so?<br>
- She had drunk too much and then revealed a secret to someone.<br>
- But&hellip; but&hellip; that was me. I wrote it down here and&hellip;<br>
- And that should never have happened. That's why Mantka sent her to Iriinuum Stonetooth.<br>
- But what did Bruutsch have to do with that? Why was he with her as well? Olko asks confused.<br>
- He came after us of his own accord. He didn't want to live without Jääni for three years.<br>
- And now they've been kidnapped. Oh, it's all my fault. I should have warned her not to drink too much. I should have told her to keep her mouth shut.<br>
- You could have chosen not to write it down, brings in Irinja.<br>
For a moment Olko is dumbfounded, No&hellip; no&hellip; knowledge is sacred. I am a student.<br>
- Olko, what should I do? says Prähnwart, I was along to protect her and I failed. And I can't go after them yet either.<br>
- You need to rest more, says Rowena, go to your mistress, she will take care of that further. She had already caught the name Mantka and recognised it.<br>
- I will save them, says Olko, a little too loudly and a little too enthusiastically. The students at the tables next to them look up momentarily perturbed and then delve back into their own conversations.<br>
- Will you come with me? But first tomorrow I have to visit Wippflügler, my master.<br>
- Ifirn commands me to help, though I want to go to the winter temple first.<br>
- Wippflügler? I've always wanted to meet him, Rowena adds.<br>
- If it is an honourable assignment I will gladly take care of the ladies' safety, Elkwin makes himself important.<br>
- I&hellip; hmm, I can go along because I am curious, but after that I really need to find a new job.<br>
- Fine, we'll go to Wippflügler early tomorrow morning. We can go from here. Landlord! Are there any beds left?<br>
- Yes, Olko.<br>
- Then you might as well spend the night here.<br>
Mulziber shuffles back and forth uncomfortably.<br>
- 'Don't worry. I will pay, says Olko.<br>
With this settled, they remain seated. Olko talks endlessly about goblins.<br>
- It is not right for people to look down on them. They have such a fascinating culture. So peaceful. Really, you won't easily see violence among goblins. And unlike most human cultures, they are completely matriarchal.<br>
Irinja coughs politely.<br>
- Well, so are Norbards actually, he admits, but goblins. Oh, their naivety. Did you know they don't even bury their dead at all? They don't have such a cult around death as we do.<br>
Hours and hours he could go on talking about goblins. Prähnwart has long since fallen asleep. They will have to take him to Mantka tomorrow, but for now they carry him up the stairs first, to bed.<br>
