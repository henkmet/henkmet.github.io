I use <em>Mysterious Island</em> by Jules Verne. To get a starting point, I rolled 5 plot points on the Adventure Crafter. After some interpretation, I determine that my character, Silas Scenay, was doing a diving training while he saw something creepy under water. It looked like a giant venomous fish, something like a stingray. At the same time, the pump supplying air to Silas springs a leak and a team of welders is needed to keep things together. Between these two events, Silas is lucky to have escaped with his life. The huge fish may be interesting as source of food if there's a shortage. We'll see if the snippets are obliging; I need to establish an objective for Silas anyway.

This preamble will serve as help to interpret the snippets drawn from the book. It's not necessarily meant as part of play. The first batch of snippets:

<p>'I should have much liked to watch that beast', said Gideon, 'yet I would rather have that you would not expose yourself. Your courage &hellip;'
'My courage is failing me, Gideon, and you wouldn't want to go down there. Nobody should. That creature seemed &hellip; evil. How can a fish cause me to blackout?'</p>

Did Silas black out because of the fish or due to equipment failure as I first imagined? Let's ask an oracle at even chance. Result: it's not because of the fish and Silas is mistaken. Nobody speaks up about a technical problem (for lack of applicable snippets) so maybe it wasn't actually noticed and they just pulled Silas out when they noticed his distress. We have met Gideon and while he seems concerned about Silas he is also the curious type. Perhaps he is the reporter? Remove the four snippets that were used and replace with new:

<p>The engineer was busy cutting away a few pieces of wood that lay between this point and that to uncover the chest and rejoined that to the air passage.
'Was there a problem with the pump?', asked Silas, still out of breath, 'You had been working on it so long the past few weeks.' He turns back to Gideon, 'I think you better get me to a place where I can rest, I &hellip;' That's as far as he gets before he vomits violently on the sand. Tension, lack of air and perhaps a mouthful of salty water did not become him well.</p>

So a defective pump after all, just that the engineer is not very talkative. So did the pump break due to poor construction, old age or is there something more sinister like sabotage? Too early to ask the oracle, maybe it will turn up on its own.

<p>Silas was laid on the long grass bordering the forests of the island. On the sands of the beach, Gideon Spilett was observing the remains of the pigeon's eggs and lithodomes that had formed Silas' breakfast. Silas' convalescence progressed rapidly and soon he was able to tell Gideon: 'I don't think that I had a bad mussel; it was all a bit too much just now. Though I have to admit, having only pigeon eggs for food is getting to me. These mussels were a lucky find but some fish would be nice for a change!'</p>

I asked the oracle whether pigeon's eggs and lithodomes (that's a kind of shellfish. I had to look it up. Silas doesn't know the word either) were their only food at even odds and got a yes. Gideon is still curious and we've a modest goal in catching fish. It may require getting rid of the scary big fish to do so in safety, or even killing that for food. Maybe we can learn a bit more about the engineer next. From now on, I will remove the first snippet of the lot, considering that if it wasn't picked yet it perhaps wasn't so interesting.

<p>'Perhaps other creeks will be an abounding source of jumping shoals of fish', replied Gideon. 'Be that as it may', says Silas, 'I am not going back in the water before the engineer has convinced me that his pump system is safe. And now that I mention him, what happened to the engineer? Is he off on one of projects again?'</p>

No news of the engineer; we must hope he is alright. It may be about time to give him a name. From Gideon's remark we can conclude that the scene is near a creek and not far out at sea. It must be a deep creek if diving gear is needed. Perhaps some rocky coast? At this point, I also want to know whether they are on an (uninhabited) island like in the book. First: Are they on an island (very likely)?: yes. The: Is the island uninhabited (likely):? yes.
