I bought Tana Pigeon's Adventure Crafter and Mythic Variations II. To familiarise myself with them, I played an adventure with mostly just these tools and without customisation. For some game mechanics, I pulled out GURPS lite. I have played the adventure in my native Dutch. The translations are done using deepl.com with very minor editing. Hopefully this maintains the tone of the play. The images are AI generated images using nightcafe. The names are from a website with random Chinese names.
